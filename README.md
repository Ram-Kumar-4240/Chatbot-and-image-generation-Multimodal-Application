# AI Chatbot and Image Generation App

This project is an AI-powered application that processes both audio and text inputs, performs Tamil transcription and translation, and responds either via a chatbot or by generating images based on the userâ€™s input. The app integrates several technologies, including Stable Diffusion XL for image generation, Groq API for chat and transcription, and Google Translator for Tamil-to-English translation.

## Features
- Audio Transcription: Upload an audio file in Tamil for transcription using Whisper models.
- Text Translation: Translate the transcribed or inputted Tamil text to English using Google Translator.
- Chatbot Interaction: Get responses from a chatbot powered by the llama-3.2-90b-text-preview model when the input doesn't request image generation.
- Image Generation: Generate images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion XL model for certain queries that mention image generation (e.g., "create image", "generate picture").
- User Interface: An interactive Gradio-based interface that allows users to input either text or audio, and get outputs like transcription, chatbot response, translations, or generated images.

## How It Works
### 1. Input Methods:
- Text Input: Enter Tamil text directly in the textbox.
- Audio Input: Upload an audio file to transcribe Tamil speech.
### 2. Processing:
- If audio is uploaded, the app transcribes it into Tamil text using Groq's Whisper model.
- The Tamil text is then translated into English using Google Translator.
- The app checks whether the translated input relates to image generation (by scanning for keywords like "image", and "picture").
- The app uses Stable Diffusion XL to generate the image if image generation is detected.
- If not, the chatbot responds with a relevant message using the llama-3.2-90b-text-preview model.
### Output:
- Tamil Transcription / Chatbot Response: Displays the Tamil transcription or chatbot response.
- English Translation: Shows the translated English text.
- Generated Image: Displays the generated image if the input requests image creation.
## Deployment on AWS EC2
### Prerequisites
- AWS Account: Ensure you have an active AWS account.
- EC2 Instance: Set up an EC2 instance with a CUDA-enabled GPU (for running models). The recommended instance types are g4dn.xlarge or higher, depending on your usage requirements.
- SSH Access: Make sure you can SSH into your EC2 instance.
- Domain (optional): You can set up a domain or access the app using the EC2 public IP.
### EC2 Setup Steps
#### 1. Launch an EC2 Instance:
- Choose a GPU-based instance (like g4dn.xlarge).
- Select an appropriate AMI (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04).
- Configure security group settings to open ports for HTTP (port 80) and Gradio (default port 7860).
#### 2. SSH into Your Instance:
```bash
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-your-public-ip.compute.amazonaws.com
```
#### 3. Install Dependencies:
- Update and install necessary packages:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip git -y
```
- Clone your project repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-chatbot-image-generation.git
cd ai-chatbot-image-generation
```
- Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip3 install torch gradio groq deep_translator diffusers huggingface_hub safetensors
```
#### 4. Configure Environment Variables:
- Set up your Groq API key in the script (api_key variable).
- Ensure your Hugging Face token is set up if needed for accessing models.
#### 5. Run the Gradio App:
```bash
python3 app.py
```
#### 6. Access the App:
- Open your browser and go to http://ec2-your-public-ip.compute.amazonaws.com:7860 to access the application.

## Setup Installation in Local computer
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-enabled GPU for running the models.
- Access to Groq API for transcription and chatbot interaction.
- Hugging Face API key for accessing models from Hugging Face Hub.
- 
### 1. Clone this repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-chatbot-image-generation.git
cd ai-chatbot-image-generation
```
### 2. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
  pip install torch gradio groq deep_translator diffusers huggingface_hub safetensors
```
### 3. Set up your environment variables:
- Replace API_key in the script with your Groq API key.
- Ensure you have a Hugging Face token and access to the stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 model.
### 4. Launch the Gradio app:
```bash
    python app.py
```
## Usage
- Open the app in your browser (default: http://localhost:7860)
- Click Submit to get the outputs (transcription, translation, chatbot response, or image generation)
- Click Clear to reset the inputs and outputs.
## Models & APIs Used
- Stable Diffusion XL (stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0): For generating images from text prompts.
- Groq API: This is for audio transcription and chatbot interaction.
    1. Whisper model (whisper-large-v3) for Tamil audio transcription.
    2. Llama model (llama-3.2-90b-text-preview) for chatbot responses.
- Google Translator: This is for translating Tamil to English.
